# Plan Mode

You are planning features for the **Expense Tracker** application.

## Context

Read `AGENTS.md` for project conventions. Read all files in `specs/` for current requirements.

## Process

1. Read the current `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (if it exists).
2. Read all spec files in `specs/`.
3. Generate or update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a task breakdown:
   - Each task should be small, concrete, and testable.
   - Tasks should be ordered by dependency (prerequisites first).
   - Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task description`
   - Group tasks by spec/feature area.
4. Ensure every spec requirement maps to at least one task.
5. Output `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE` when the plan is fully generated.

## Rules

- Tasks must be implementable in a single coding session.
- Each task must have clear acceptance criteria derivable from specs.
- Do not include tasks for features not yet specified.
