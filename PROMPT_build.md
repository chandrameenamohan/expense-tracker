# Build Mode

You are building the **Expense Tracker** application. Follow these instructions precisely.

## Context

Read `AGENTS.md` for project conventions. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the current task list.

## Process

1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and find the next uncompleted task (marked with `[ ]`).
2. Read the relevant spec file(s) in `specs/` for requirements.
3. Implement the task:
   - Write code in `src/`
   - Write tests in `tests/`
   - Ensure `bun test` passes
   - Ensure `bun run typecheck` passes
4. Mark the task as `[x]` in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
5. If all tasks are complete, output `ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE`.

## Rules

- Follow specs exactly. Do not add features not in specs.
- Write tests before or alongside implementation.
- Keep commits atomic — one task per commit.
- If a task is blocked or unclear, add a note in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and move to the next task.
